### A React & Express web app single instance implementation of the Cabo card game

These are the official rules:

I decided to implement two deviations from these, as we use to play it like that: 
- Cabo can be called any time during your turn, you don't have to skip your regular turn in order to call Cabo
- When a player attempts to swap non-matching cards for a new one, they have to not only keep the cards but also the drawn card
